## Why
I believe in long term content and that pages should [last](https://jeffhuang.com/designed_to_last/).

## Where
This static site is deployed to [Pages](https://developers.cloudflare.com/pages/) with naked domain redirect, and backed up to [GCP](https://cloud.google.com/source-repositories/docs).

## How
This site follows the structure below.

- `/recipes/{recipe.html}`
- `/articles/{article.html}`
- `/about`
